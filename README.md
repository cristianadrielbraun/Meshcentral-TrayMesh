# TrayMesh
Deserved Tray Icon for MeshCentral Agent


	THIS IS A PROOF OF CONCEPT VERSION. FULLY FUNCTIONAL, BUT FAR FOR THE FINAL IDEA. 
	FOR NOW, IS JUST A BINARY FILE, AND THAT'S IS (+ 2 DLL ON WINDOWS VERSION).
	HOPEFULLY THIS WILL EVOLVE IN A WELL INTEGRATED PLUGIN FOR MESHCENTRAL, AND INSTALLER, AND A FEW CUSTOMIZABLE OPTIONS.
